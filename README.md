# Offline Budget Tracker

## The Short Version:
This code allows you to add and subtract transactions, view these transactions in a graph and save them both online and offline.

## More in-depth user control:
 * Utilises the caches to store data for offline
 * Sets up a service-worker and indexed database for offline transactions
 * saves data for user to find later
